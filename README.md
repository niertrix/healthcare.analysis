## Project Objectives

- Analyse the number and frequency of patients visitng medical institutions.
- Determine the most common types of cases based on trends in data
- Create a comprehensive dashboard to visually represent the collected data

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: *TBA*
- **Volume**: *TBA*
- **Attributes**: *TBA*

## Technologies and Tools

| Task | Tools |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Data Cleaning | Python |
| Data Manipulation | SQL, Python, and Power Query |
| Visualisation | Tableau, Power BI |
| Version Control | Git, Github |

## Methodology

1. Clean the collected data and build a data model using it.
2. Analyse the data model and create the needed measures.
3. Forecast the data in order to predict future cases.
4.  Visualize the data using Tableau dashboards.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

-**Number of Staff**: The availablity of doctors on shift can be critical in emergency situations. We must make sure that there are enough available staff to handle incoming cases.
-**Medicine Storage**: The availablitiy of medicine is also crucial. Most patients require immediate treatment and thus there must be a handful of available medicine on-site.
